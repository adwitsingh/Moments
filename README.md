# Moments
A Python application which captures moments of happiness and surprise from a video stream of one or more people using OpenCV. GUI designed using Qt 4 Designer.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project needs python 2 installed on the local machine along with *cv2*, *numpy*, *statistics* and *keras* which can be installed using:

```bash
$ python -m pip install cv2
$ python -m pip install numpy
$ python -m pip install keras
$ python -m pip install statistics
```



## Running

main.py defines all the functions and can be run using:

```bash
$ python main.py
```

This will run a GUI where the video stream and capturing can be controlled using **Start** and **Stop**

***TODO:*** Automatic capturing using countdown timer
